This directory represents a sample test. The "prefs.txt" file is the
test preference file, with "in?.txt" and "out?.txt" defining the unit
tests.

Student submissions are in the "sdoy", "user87", and "ysvan" directories
(which represent usernames), and their reports are in "Results".

The reports contain the marking scheme and a solution, which are defined
in "markingScheme.txt" and "Solution.java", respectively.
